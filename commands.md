Commands
========

"Youmf" follows a unix-like command system. I've made some minor changes to make it easier on me and the client, but you can expect almost everything to be the same, sans some tasg and arguments.

Filesystem
==========

cd <directory>
--
Change working directory (wdir) to the directory asked by the client

| Arguments |                              |
|:---------:|:----------------------------:|
| directory | where you want to point wdir |
