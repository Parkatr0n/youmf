"Youmf" is a project involving a command line in a browser. The entirety of the website is on one page, no login page, etc. You get the idea.

The user is presented with **this screen** (insert picture and I'm sorry) when they first open the website.

```
$
```

The user can only `login`, or `signup`.

```
$ signup

```
$ login Parkatr0n

Password for Parkatr0n:

After the password is inputted, the screen is refreshed, and a new console appears.

```
Parkatr0n@147.252.27.79:/drive/$ 
```

Note that the IP address stated is random, and is generated when you create your account. It is, of course, unique.
