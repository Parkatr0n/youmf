=====

"Youmf" is a project involving a command line in a browser. The entirety of the website is on one page, no login page, etc. You get the idea.

You can interact with other people's accounts, work on your files, write scripts to hack other machines, etc. You could also technically make your own "website" by opening your robots file to HTTP.

I haven't hosted any code here, because I'm still debating on whether or not to make the project open-source. I'm leaning 50/50 both ways, though. I'm using this repo for now as a public workbook of everything that will be added.

The word "youmf" is my favorite word, that isn't a word, I just came up with it, and I like it. I named the project folder youmf because I couldn't think of a name, and I'm hoping it doesn't stick until the alpha.
